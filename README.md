# PortGen âœ¨

**Instantly generate beautiful, minimal, and deployable portfolios from your content.**

## Overview

PortGen is an open-source web application designed to help professionals showcase their work with zero hassle. It's an intelligent system that transforms your resume into a stunning, professional portfolio website.

Our goal is to create the most seamless experience for generating a professional online presence, giving users full control over their narrative without needing to write a single line of code.

## Why Choose PortGen?

The world has great tools for showcasing work, like social platforms (Behance, Dribbble) and powerful builders (Semplice, Webflow). PortGen is designed to fit a different, crucial need.

| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**           | **Get Hired.**                          | Get Likes.                        | Build a Website.                        |
| **Speed**          | **Minutes.**                            | Instant, but not a portfolio.     | Days.                                   |
| **Ownership**      | **You own the brand.** (`yourname.com`) | You are a user on their platform. | You own the tech stack.                 |
| **Overhead**       | **Zero.** It just works.                | None, but you don't control it.   | **High.** WordPress, hosting, security. |
| **Learning Curve** | **None.**                               | Easy.                             | Steep.                                  |

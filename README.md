# PortGen âœ¨

**Instantly generate beautiful, minimal, and deployable portfolios from your content.**

## Overview

PortGen is an open-source web application designed to help professionals showcase their work with zero hassle. It's an intelligent system that transforms your contentâ€”be it a resume, a folder of images, or project notesâ€”into a stunning, professional portfolio website.

Our goal is to create the most seamless experience for generating a professional online presence, giving users full control over their narrative without needing to write a single line of code.

## Why Choose PortGen?

The world has great tools for showcasing work, like social platforms (Behance, Dribbble) and powerful builders (Semplice, Webflow). PortGen is designed to fit a different, crucial need.

| **Goal**           | **Get Hired.**                          | Get Likes.                        | Build a Website.                        |
| **Speed**          | **Minutes.**                            | Instant, but not a portfolio.     | Days.                                   |
| **Ownership**      | **You own the brand.** (`yourname.com`) | You are a user on their platform. | You own the tech stack.                 |
| **Overhead**       | **Zero.** It just works.                | None, but you don't control it.   | **High.** WordPress, hosting, security. |
| **Learning Curve** | **None.**                               | Easy.                             | Steep.                                  |

1.  **From Content to Live in Minutes**: We automate the presentation. You provide your work and your story, and our intelligent, opinionated themes handle the complex design work for you. You get a world-class result, instantly.

## The Flawless Portfolio: Launch Plan

For our initial launch, we will focus on a world-class experience for three key personas.

### 1. The Software Developer

**Goal:** Showcase technical expertise, project impact, and professional experience.

- **Initial Action**: Upload a resume.
- **Instant Result**: A fully populated portfolio with sections for experience, projects (with source code links and live links), skills and education.
- **Launch Theme: "Monaco"**: A clean, text-focused, professional theme.

### 2. The Photographer

**Goal:** Create an immersive, unobtrusive visual experience where the images are the hero.

- **Initial Action**: Upload a folder of photos.
- **Instant Result**: A beautiful, minimal gallery of your work with a fast, full-screen lightbox.
- **Launch Theme: "Kyoto"**: An image-first, minimalist theme designed to make photos pop.

### 3. The Designer (UI/UX, Product)

**Goal:** Blend visual polish with compelling storytelling to explain the "why" behind the work.

- **Initial Action**: Upload a collection of your best design shots (JPEGs, PNGs).
- **Instant Result**: A `VisualShowcase`â€”a stunning, grid-based portfolio of your work. This gives you a professional presence in seconds.
- **The Power-Up**: For any project in your showcase, you can choose to **"Add the Story."** This converts it into a rich `CaseStudy` block, allowing you to add detailed sections about your process, from problem to solution. This is how you show off your thinking, not just your pixels.
- **Launch Theme: "Bauhaus"**: A theme with a strong grid system and bold typography, perfect for balancing visuals and text in both simple showcases and detailed case studies.
